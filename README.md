# Global_Renewable_Energy

This project compares statistics collected from multiple sources on national production of renewable energy along with several categories of auxillary statistics used to draw insight and conclusions as to relational data between nations.  Specific research questions are found in the notebook.  Overall goal is to clean and synthesize multiple data sets into one analysis to compare renewable energy production, litigation, and economic output.
